# Known Issues:
* Setlist.fm has issues with some artists, such as MØ. You may be able to avoid this by replacing the unicode characters with regular ones.
* Python 2 may also have issues with unicode characters.
* Your terminal may try and interpret characters as control sequences. Use the text file input if you have issues with this. For example, A$AP Rocky.
